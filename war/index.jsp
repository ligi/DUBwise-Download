				<p>This site is intended for getting <a href="http://www.mikrokopter.de/ucwiki/en/DUBwise">DUBwise</a> on your Phone.
				 As a first step you should read <a href="help.jsp">The Help.</a>
				 <a href="downloads.jsp"> get the Installer</a>. Then you have the choice of the Install Method. You can use the online-install method in the installer - this is the easyest way but it might produce some traffic costs by your provider. Or you download your version via the install code calculated by the installer on <a href="download_by_code.jsp">this site </a>.</p>
